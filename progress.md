Here I will write what was done step by step:

Installed Wireshark
Watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTaOZrDnMzQ Wireshark Tutorial for Beginners | Network Scanning Made Easy

Was able to understand the layout of Wireshark app and now understand how to filter source/destinations/protocols and how to check useful info based on filters.

We are continuing now.
So I saved Â±510 packets of data transfered through DATA Shark.
I am trying to analyze packets and maybe find traffic that was sent through my home Wi-Fi network. In order to understand in details that I understood the nature of the traffic, the objective was to identify the packets that were sent through my phone, I access github on my phone , two links. Let's see if I can locate it.

Ok, understood some more details, what is NAT, ipv4, ipv6. Understood that may need more time to detect traffic. 
There are more settings to a network.
