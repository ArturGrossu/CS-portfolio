Here I will write what was done step by step:

Installed Wireshark
Watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTaOZrDnMzQ Wireshark Tutorial for Beginners | Network Scanning Made Easy

Was able to understand the layout of Wireshark app and now understand how to filter source/destinations/protocols and how to check useful info based on filters.
